# Interactive Avatar 
A simple frontend project with a dynamic and interactive colorpicker and vector graphics.

## About the project
I created this project early in 2023 and it was my first real attempt at using vector graphics in a web development environment. It started with me simply wanted to try out Material-UI and I thought it would be fun to try and create my own logo in the header. I based that logo off my son's then favourite toy which was a small robot. That logo has since been removed, but I was still curious whether or not I could create something bigger, something more interactive with the vector images. That turned into the now finished **Interactive Lela Picker**! 

I had tons of fun with drawing all the different versions of myself and I've learned so much about working with vector graphics. 

Now I have moved on to other projects but this one I will always hold dear as it was my first big project ❤️
