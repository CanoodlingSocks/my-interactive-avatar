# Interactive Avatar 
This is a personal project where I use React, TypeScript, and Material-UI to experiment with vector graphics. The website is designed to be responsive with both desktop and mobile modes.

## About the project
In this project, I've experimented with vector graphics to create a navbar with a vector logo of my son's favourite toy robot, and an interactive vector image of myself. This is my first real attempt at using vector graphics in a web development environment.

## Technologies Used
* React
* TypeScript
* Material-UI
* Vector graphics, made in Vectornator

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run ```npm install``` in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run ```npm start``` to start the application.
4. Open 'localhost:3000/' in your web browser to view the web page.
