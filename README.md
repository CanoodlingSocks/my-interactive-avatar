## About the project
This is a personal project where I'm using React, TypeScript and Material-UI.
In this project I've experimented with vector graphics, making a navbar with a vector logo of my son's favourite toy robot and a interactive vector image of myself. 

I've always been curious of vector graphics and this is my first real attempt at using it in a web development environment.

I want to make the website repsonsive with a desktop and a mobile mode using Material-UI.
